                        <p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard
                        Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure.</p>
                        <p>They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on 
                        his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.</p>

                        <p>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all 
                        others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and after many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in the Hobbit.</p>
                        <p>In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to care. Frodo must leave his home 
                        and make a perilous journey across Middle-Earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.</p>

                        <p>Essential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Lúthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was an immortal elf. Her father, a 
                        great elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Lúthien.</p>
                        <p>This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Lúthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called Morgoth, the 
                        Black Enemy, of a Silmaril.</p>

                        <p>Gondolin was a secret city of Elves in the First Age of Middle-earth. The Fall of Gondolin tells of the founding of the city; of the arrival there of Tuor, a prince of Men; of 
                        the betrayal of the city to Morgoth by the king's nephew, Maeglin; and of its subsequent catastrophic destruction by Morgoth's armies.</p>
                        <p>It also relates the flight of the fugitives to the Havens of Sirion, the wedding of Tuor and Idril, as well as the childhood of Eärendil.</p>
